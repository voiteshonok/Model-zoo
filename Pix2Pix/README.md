# Pix2Pix

["Image-to-Image Translation with Conditional Adversarial Networks (aka Pix2Pix)"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07004) is a framework of conditional GAN as a general-purpose solution to image-to-image translation problems.

If you don't have a dataset you could rather download it by following lines:
<pre><code>wget http://efrosgans.eecs.berkeley.edu/pix2pix/datasets/facades.tar.gz
tar -xvf facades.tar.gz</code></pre>

Sorry, I haven't waited the convergence
